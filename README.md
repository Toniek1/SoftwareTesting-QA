# Portfolio - Software Testing
Hi! This is my portfolio repository with stuff related to software testing. I'am manual tester, learning how to automate this process (actually in python, willing to learn java too). My goal is to become penetration / security tester. 
All the things that i put up in this repository are made by me.
